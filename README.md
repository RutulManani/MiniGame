# Gravity Soccer - Zero-G 2-Player MiniGame ⚽🚀

An innovative twist on classic air hockey and soccer games — in space! Gravity Soccer brings fast-paced, zero-gravity action to your browser, where two players compete in a frictionless arena with dynamic gravity wells.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Gravity Soccer is a two-player arcade-style game that reimagines soccer with space physics. The ball floats freely in a zero-G environment, and each player can strategically activate a gravity well near their goal to influence the ball's trajectory.
